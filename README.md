This is the project made with Flask, Bootstrap and Edamam library. Searching recipes by the specific ingredients and diet limitations is the key idea of this project.
The list of matched recipes is shown together with the image and link to the recipe.
Responsive design was used here, so that the app looks good both on mobile devices and web-browsers.
